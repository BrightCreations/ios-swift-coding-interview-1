## Philosophy

The goal of this challenge is to get insight on how you approach an everyday task, not a hypothetical algorithm unicorn puzzle of doom. Complete the challenge by writing code that you would write again any day and pick up with ease 5 years from now. Basically, write code you're proud of.

### How to Submit your work

Please submit your work by the deadline provided and please send us a github link for your work.

## Tasks

There are a few tasks in this code challenge, each with a specific focus for you to show us how you work.  This should take a maximum of 1-2 hours.

### Create your application

Please create a new application called "**yourfullname**-coding-challenge-1" replacing the prefix with your fullname please.

### Can you Network?

Show us how you build a great networking layer and retrieve data from a third party API.

Using the infamous [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/), retrieve a list of all breeds of dogs available through the API.  Then retrieve a random image for each breed (one is fine)

This should happen on loading the application.

### Persist the data

Store the list of breeds into Core Data.  Use whatever structure makes sense in the database once loading the data.

Also, show us how you would set one breed in NSDefaults (whatever breed you prefer).

### Can you animate?

Using any of the animations found [here](https://medium.com/@dinolaw/22-best-swift-animation-libraries-in-early-2020-8f76d39e0bcb) or elsehwere for that matter - create a cool bit of animation to show the list of breeds that are retrieved from the API as well as a random image for each breed.

You can use a TableView, CollectionView or any other list view of your choosing.  Show us something you think looks great and has an interesting UX.

### Unit Testing

Write at unit test for the networking layer.

### Document

Create a README file documenting how to setup your application and any decisions you made along the way.
